This website is all about my adventures in data analysis, where I’m tracking my progress and sharing what I learn along the way. I really wanted to create a space not just for myself, but for anyone else who’s diving into the world of data. We all know there’s a lot of confusion out there about what data analysts do compared to data engineers or those data visualization folks, right? So, whether you’re just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding, I hope you find some useful insights here that clear up the fog and help you on your journey, too!

## About me
I’m currently a candidate for the Master of Data and Decision Analytics at the University of Edinburgh, which is super exciting! I’ve spent over five years working with data, and my main focus has been uncovering the insights that are often hidden beneath all those complicated numbers. I really believe that data has so much more to say than just the surface-level information we often see. It’s like a treasure trove waiting to be explored, and I’m eager to dive deeper into it and learn how to make better decisions based on those insights.

## About this website
1. The primary objective of this website is to document my evolving knowledge and experiences in the field of data analysis. I am excited to share insights and reflections on my journey, with plans to begin posting detailed journey pages shortly; you can find the directory for these entries [here]().
